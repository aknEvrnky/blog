First, you need to install npm to use gulp.js and other plugins which I used.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

 * gulp

    ```sh
    gulp
    ```

Secondly, you have to start the git.

  ```sh
  git init  
  git add .
  git commit -m "first commit"
  branch -M master
  ```
    

Git has been installed succesfully and you need to push it to cloud.

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/aknEvrnky/[directory].git
git push -M master
```
