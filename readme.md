First, you need to install npm to use gulp.js and other plugins which I used.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

  * gulp

  ```sh
  gulp
  ```

Secondly, you have to start the git.
## git init

## git add .
## git commit -m "first commit"
## git branch -M master

Git has been installed succesfully and you need to push it to cloud.

## git remote add origin https://github.com/aknEvrnky/[directory].git

## git push -M master
